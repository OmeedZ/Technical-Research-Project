Female,Any other STEM major,Strongly Agree,Sometimes,Frequently,Strongly agree,Frequently,Somewhat Agree,"While I no longer study STEM, in my experience from when I was for about 4 years, it is very clear as a woman that women are not respected in the field and underrepresented. In those 4 years, only one of my professors was a woman and in many of those classes I would be one of few women. Often times, my issue was not with the professors because many were great, it was rather my peers who spoke over me, diminish my feelings, and wouldn’t allow me to effectively contribute in group settings. Many of the men that are in STEM fields create very hostile environments and I know from experience that it drives many women away."

Female,Any other STEM major,Agree,Rarely,Never,Agree,Sometimes,Strongly Disagree,"I experienced no sexism in high school in Iran. Most of my science teachers were female. And, most girls my age were interested in studying science (including engineering) or medicine. 
The situation was reversed in US. Most science professors were male and I heard from female students that they didn’t want to study science because it was hard or they wanted to start a family and didn’t want to work as a scientist. My father was my strongest advocate for pursuing science and have a career."
